# stream-guardian-js

Stream Guardian JS is a library designed to safeguard streaming content recorded in web browsers. By utilizing the Origin Private File System (OPFS), it ensures that all recorded streams are securely saved locally on the user's device. This system not only protects the recordings but also facilitates the recovery of recorded files, ensuring that your data remains intact and accessible.

## Features

- Secure Recording: Ensures all streaming content is securely recorded in the browser.
- Local Storage: Utilizes OPFS for saving data locally on the user's device.
- Data Recovery: Facilitates easy recovery of recorded files.
- Using web workers: Utilizes web workers to ensure that the recording process does not affect the performance of the main thread.
